The movement direction of the card can be realized through the player\'s gesture operation. If the same card collides, it will be merged into a higher level card, and different cards collide , It will rely on neighboring. After the card is successfully moved, the game will generate another card in the blank square, which is used to synthesize a higher-level card. When there are no identical cards that can be collided by movement and no blank squares in the game, it means the game is over. Players can view the highest score records and their current scores in the game interface, and can view historical scores in the leaderboard. There are ten historical records saved in the leaderboard.</string>
